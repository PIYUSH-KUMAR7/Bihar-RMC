      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-gray leading-relaxed mb-12">
        Ready Mix Concrete, often referred to as RMC, is a specially formulated blend of cement, aggregates, water and
        admixtures. This pre-mixed concrete is manufactured in our state-of-the-art batching plants, ensuring
        consistency in quality, strength, and durability. RMC simplifies construction by eliminating the need for
        on-site mixing, reducing labor and minimizing wastage.
